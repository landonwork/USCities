# Cross-sectional Data of U.S. Cities
## Extracted from city-data.com

This is Landon Work's public repository with Python and R scripts
and, sadly, none of the data for his analysis of cities across
the United States. (I do not feel like figuring out how to put my
data on GitHub with the large files and all. The analysis will come first.)

I am looking primarily at economic well-being and opportunity. The sample
is imperfect since I do not know how to tell if there is a relationship
between cities that do not have sites on city-data.com and other factors
or if it is truly random, but hopefully the size of the data set
can make up for accuracy somewhat with precision.

I will include updates to my progress as I go.
